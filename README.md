# Life In Weeks

This Streamlit project is an interactive tool that calculates and visualizes the number of weeks a user has lived and the number of weeks until their future birthday. Inspired by the article "Your Life in Weeks" by Wait But Why, the project helps users gain insights into the passage of time and visualize their life in terms of weeks. Users input their birth date and the future birthday they want to consider, and the app calculates the corresponding weeks lived and weeks until the future birthday. The visualization uses circles to represent weeks, where each row contains 52 circles, and the colored circles indicate the weeks lived. The project aims to provide a unique perspective on the passage of time and inspire users to make the most of their weeks.
